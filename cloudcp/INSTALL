1. $ sudo apt-get install nginx php5-cgi php5-curl libfcgi-perl libfcgi-procmanager-perl
2. /etc/rc.local add:

   /opt/ovzcp/cloudcp/sysconf/run-cgi

3. # rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   # ln -s /opt/ovzcp/cloudcp/sysconf/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
4. touch /opt/ozvcp/cloudcp/users
5. Edit /etc/default/rsync:

   RSYNC_ENABLE=true
   RSYNC_CONFIG_FILE=/opt/ovzcp/cloudcp/sysconf/rsyncd.conf

6. Create /opt/ovzcp/cloudcp/sysconf/rsync.passwd with username:password (used in rsync)
7. $ sudo /etc/init.d/rsync start
8. On the other server setup cron to run: (sudo crontab -e)

   */5 * * * * RSYNC_PASSWORD="password" rsync rsync://username@server/cloudcp /path/to/storage -qrptz --del --log-file=/var/log/cloudcp.sync.log

   (Note: other server can use any server, including one without scriptablity. However I recommends that you should run 404.exe as your
   404 handler. This in fact a PHP file. Make sure you set the $nextMirror to your master server's URL WITH trailing slash. If something couldn't
   be found on your replication server, it will redirect the client to the master server instead.)
    
Note that you should run nginx at port 80 on an IP by change the listen line in /opt/ovzcp/cloudcp/sysconf/default
