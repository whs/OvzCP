OvzCP was created above my old infrastructure which is:

- Home networking
- 1 IP (DMZed from the router)
- 4-5 VM
- 1 Administrator

but when I modelled OvzCP I make some decision change like add the billing
system and my laziness make me lazy to make a role system thus all user
permision is equal.
